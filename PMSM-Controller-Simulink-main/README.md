# Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Controller in MATLAB Simulink

This project implements a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Control: Field-Oriented Control with Simulink

- the block diagrams were developed in Simulink 2017.
- report of results are in the documentation.

## About the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs)

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are brushless and have very high reliability and efficiency. Due to their permanent magnet rotor, they also have higher torque with smaller frame size and no rotor current, all of which are advantages over AC Induction Motors (AICMs). With their high power-to-size ratio, PMSMs can help make your design smaller without the loss of torque. PMSMs need to be commutated like BLDC motors, but due to the construction of the windings, the waveforms need to be sinusoidal for good performance. Because this requires more sophisticated control algorithms
